## ‚ö° System Design

In the following, we define two problems that are at the center of the chatbot system. The first problem aims to realize the ability of natural language understanding, i.e., developing the necessary mechanism for the software system to understand natural language questions as a human would do. The second problem aims to extract the relevant information from a domain-specific database so that answers can be generated to be fed back to the user. Typically, a dialogue system architecture can be divided into 2 main parts:

- The natural language processing core consists of 3 tasks:
    - Natural Language Understanding (NLU) includes human intent recognition and name-entity recognition.
    - Dialogue Management (DM) defines the content of the next utterance and thus the behavior of the dialogue system.
    - Natural Language Generation (NLG) is based on existing sentence patterns and replaces found information based on semantic frameworks.
- User interface and management interface for administrators:
    - The user interface includes a live chat application on the website and a mobile chat application.
    - The database management tool for administrators to ensure full implementation of the basic CRUD operations that is **MONGODB**

## ‚öíÔ∏è Quickstart

To re-product the project, please refer to the repository


The structure of source code:

```bash
Chatbot-University-Consultancy
|--README.md
|--requirements.txt
|--src
	|--core

	|--backend

	|--channels
|--.env
```

Most of the modules are scripted in the Python language version 3.

Let‚Äôs install the library

```bash
$pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create the ```.env``` file containing the connection string to the MongoDB service as the variable environment
```
MONGOLAB_URI="mongodb://dev1:abc13579@thesis-shard-00-00.bdisf.mongodb.net:27017,thesis-shard-00-01.bdisf.mongodb.net:27017,thesis-shard-00-02.bdisf.mongodb.net:27017/hcmut?ssl=true&replicaSet=atlas-12fynb-shard-0&authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority"
```

Try using the static function

```bash
$python src/main.py --message "cho em xin ƒëi·ªÉm chu·∫©n ng√†nh ƒëi·ªán ƒëi·ªán t·ª≠ v·ªõi ·∫°"
```
Try using with API
```bash
$python src/backend/manage.py runserver
```
The ouptut is shown

This message implies there is an API that are listening on the port 8000 of your machine. To call this:
```cURL
$curl --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/conversation' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "message": "cho em xin ch·ªâ ti√™u tuy·ªÉn sinh nƒÉm 2020 c·ªßa kh·ªëi A1 ng√†nh ƒëi·ªán ƒëi·ªán t·ª≠?"
}'
